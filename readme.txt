Description:

To evaluate our model, we have collected a new set of pairwise ranking data from 615 posters to form an evaluation dataset. We selected 2,000 pairs for each of the 15 pre-defined personalities. We conducted pairwise comparisons using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). 

The posters are stored in "./imgs". 

The annotation is saved as "./annotations/relative_comparisons.mat".
